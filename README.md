# CloudGAN: Generating atmospheric cloud fields using generative adversarial networks

This project investigates the potential of using generative adversarial networks
(GANs) to generate cloud fields.

## Dependencies

I put together some of the code that I had to read data in a package called
`wxdata` available from my github account. To install it run

```
git clone https://github.com/simonpf/wxdata
cd wxdata
pip install -e .
```
